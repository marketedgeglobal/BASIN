    "focus": "BASIN's inclusive market systems development approach recognises that economic growth alone is insufficient. All value chain interventions must deliberately address the structural barriers that exclude women, persons with disabilities, and the most marginalised smallholders from participating in and benefiting from market growth. Cross-cutting themes of gender equality, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability are integrated into every intervention design, monitoring framework, and partnership approach.",

        "title": "Gender-Based Market Exclusion",
        "gist": "Women often face systematic exclusion from high-value nodes of value chains — including access to finance, certified inputs, and formal contracts — due to discriminatory social norms and legal barriers. BASIN interventions must actively address these structural constraints rather than assuming market growth will trickle down."
